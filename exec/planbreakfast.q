Returns the indices at which L, when flipped and then transformed with 
  function TF return true for the predicate REQF.

We must now traverse back through our solutions to convert the FPIS
  (fatpassingindices) to the names of their corresponding food combination
  of an element of AS and an element of BS.
  
To do this it goes from FPIS back into the ppis, selecting only those
  which passes the fat test, then from ppis back into cpis, again, 
  selecting only those which have passed the first two tests, and then
  finally it turns these indices into names. This explains why this
  function requres C and P and parameters
